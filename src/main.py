"""
    Hypercorn Server Runner Script

    This script is used to run a FastAPI app using Hypercorn, a performant ASGI server. 
    It supports production and development configurations and dynamically calculates 
    the number of worker processes based on CPU cores (currently hardcoded to 1 for simplicity).

    Functions:
        get_worker_count(): Returns the recommended number of worker processes.
        run_hypercorn(): Constructs and executes the Hypercorn command with desired configurations.

    Usage:
        python main.py             # Runs in production mode
        python main.py --dev      # Runs in development mode with auto-reload enabled

    Log Format:
        Logs HTTP request details in a structured format for better observability.

    Environment:
        - Requires Hypercorn to be installed in the environment.
        - Expects the FastAPI app to be available at `main:app`.

    Note:
        Adjust worker count in production by uncommenting the `get_worker_count()` line.

def get_worker_count():

def run_hypercorn():

    Builds and executes the Hypercorn server command to run a FastAPI application.
